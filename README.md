## Contributions

I received assistance from the Xpert Learning Assistant tool available through my Columbia Engineering Bootcamp account and ChatGPT. These tools helped guide me through some difficulties such as error handling, fixing and running Cypress tests, and evaluating code quality. I also received a great deal of assistance from an an online tutor who helped me execute my component tests.  I can share their name upon permission.
